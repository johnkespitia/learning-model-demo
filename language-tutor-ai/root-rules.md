1. Reporte de Clase (6 reglas)
1.
WHEN the student makes a recurring error in a specific communicative task
THEN provide timely and constructive feedback focused on the achievement and the specific gap
BECAUSE precise feedback promotes measurable progress and sustains motivation [1].
2.
WHEN the student shows observable stress signals (avoidance, silence, task abandonment)
THEN record an emotional indicator in the class report using learning diaries or checklists
BECAUSE managing the affective dimension is a major influence on learning success [2].
3.
WHEN students show passive behavior or lack of participation in virtual classrooms
THEN implement interactive tools like shared documents or digital boards to monitor contributions in real-time
BECAUSE active engagement is required to prevent drop-outs and ensure effective learning [3, 4].
4.
WHEN the student completes a thematic unit or a project module
THEN include a reflection section comparing initial goals vs achieved outcomes
BECAUSE metacognitive awareness fosters independent and successful language learners [1].
5.
WHEN the learner is a child AND parents are unable to help with English homework due to language barriers in the household
THEN ask them to have the child explain the new concepts in their native language
BECAUSE paraphrasing concepts in L1 ensures the student has understood the underlying logic [5].
6.
WHEN a child is hesitant to speak the second language in front of others or in public settings
THEN advise parents to avoid forcing the child to perform and instead build L2 vocabulary through home routines
BECAUSE reducing pressure and connecting school language with home experiences prevents anxiety [6, 7].

2. Plan de Clases (4 reglas)
7.
WHEN starting a new lesson or a teaching module
THEN negotiate and set realistic goals with the students while explaining the purpose of each activity
BECAUSE clear, shared objectives increase student commitment and clarify the learning purpose [8].
8.
WHEN teaching classes with diverse or limited access to digital technology
THEN adopt project-based or interdisciplinary learning models (intercurricular)
BECAUSE integrating subjects maximizes resources and provides a non-fragmented learning experience [9, 10].
9.
WHEN designing the content and tasks for a language session
THEN integrate elements of the target culture as a central aspect of the activities
BECAUSE cultural understanding is central to effective language learning and develops global empathy [11].
10.
WHEN planning a synchronous session in a remote or hybrid environment
THEN send "pre-challenges" or preparatory materials as asynchronous tasks before the live meeting
BECAUSE advance preparation allows maximizing synchronous time for active interaction and discussion [12].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Ejercicios Personalizados (4 reglas)
11.
WHEN selecting input materials for a specific student's level
THEN ensure the difficulty level is at "i + 1" (slightly beyond their current proficiency)
BECAUSE input must be challenging enough to trigger acquisition but clear enough via context [13].
12.
WHEN a student struggles to comprehend natural-paced audio recordings in the target language
THEN provide the audio file with a playback speed reduced to approximately 70%
BECAUSE controlled playback speed significantly improves comprehensibility for learners [14].
13.
WHEN a student faces limitations in speaking or writing due to specific vocabulary gaps
THEN allow and encourage the use of compensation strategies like synonyms, mimes, or gestures
BECAUSE compensation strategies are essential for maintaining communication flow and building competence [15].
14.
WHEN a student has difficulty remembering new vocabulary through reading or passive listening alone
THEN assign productive tasks focused on those specific words in a new context
BECAUSE productive tasks are more effective for word retention and long-term recall [16].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Informe de Forma de Aprender (4 reglas)
15.
WHEN the student needs to identify their own learning strengths and weaknesses
THEN include a structured self-evaluation section comparing learning strategies (LLS)
BECAUSE identifying personal preferences helps students auto-direct their own learning process [17, 18].
16.
WHEN a student lacks direction or awareness of their own learning progress
THEN implement the use of learning diaries or "temperature" checklists to help them self-monitor
BECAUSE self-monitoring allows students to adjust their efforts and gain independence [2].
17.
WHEN integrating new learning strategies into the student's academic routine
THEN select strategies based on the student's age, proficiency level, and specific learning challenges and justify the selected strategies based on age, CEFR level, and error patterns
BECAUSE strategies must be context-appropriate and personalized to be effective and sustainable [19].
18.
WHEN a student relies exclusively on external rewards like grades to justify their effort
THEN focus the report on the practical uses of the language and the internal satisfaction of the progress
BECAUSE internal motivation leads to more sustainable and long-term academic success [20].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Cierre de Ciclo (2 reglas)
19.
WHEN concluding a teaching cycle or school term
THEN use assessment tools that measure both fluency and accuracy within a communicative context
BECAUSE evaluation should promote and measure learning progress comprehensively rather than just testing facts [1].
20.
WHEN reviewing the success of the learning environment at the end of a cycle
THEN evaluate the effectiveness of the safety, behavior, and diversity policies implemented
BECAUSE protected and inclusive environments are necessary for students to feel safe to use the target language [21].

📘 BLOQUE A — READING (5 reglas)
21. Reading – Scanning vs Understanding

WHEN a student can decode text but fails to identify key information
THEN design reading tasks that explicitly separate scanning (facts) from global understanding (main idea)
BECAUSE distinguishing reading purposes improves comprehension efficiency.

22. Reading – Vocabulary overload

WHEN a student stops reading frequently due to unknown vocabulary
THEN limit pre-teaching to high-frequency or task-critical words only
BECAUSE excessive pre-teaching increases cognitive load and reduces reading flow.

23. Reading – Literal comprehension only

WHEN a student answers reading questions only at a literal level
THEN include guided inference questions (why / how / intention)
BECAUSE inferential reading develops deeper comprehension and autonomy.

24. Reading – Motivation through relevance

WHEN a student shows low engagement with reading texts
THEN select materials aligned with the student’s interests or real-life goals
BECAUSE personal relevance increases persistence and comprehension.

25. Reading – Re-reading dependency

WHEN a student rereads the same paragraph multiple times without improvement
THEN introduce time-limited reading followed by gist questions
BECAUSE controlled time pressure encourages strategic reading instead of word-by-word decoding.

🎧 BLOQUE B — LISTENING (5 reglas)
26. Listening – Gist vs detail confusion

WHEN a student understands details but misses the overall message
THEN structure listening tasks into gist-first, detail-second stages
BECAUSE sequencing listening goals improves mental organization of input.

27. Listening – Accent sensitivity

WHEN a student comprehends scripted audio but struggles with different accents
THEN progressively introduce accent variation after comprehension is established
BECAUSE gradual exposure builds listening flexibility without frustration.

28. Listening – Cognitive overload

WHEN a student shows stress signals during long listening tasks
THEN chunk the audio into short segments with micro-tasks
BECAUSE shorter input units reduce cognitive overload and anxiety.

29. Listening – Passive listening

WHEN a student listens without being able to recall key points
THEN require a simple output task (note, keyword, drawing) after listening
BECAUSE output forces active processing of auditory input.

30. Listening – Overreliance on repetition

WHEN a student repeatedly asks for audio repetition without strategy change
THEN assign a listening focus (numbers, names, actions) before replay
BECAUSE focused listening increases efficiency and confidence.

🗣️ BLOQUE C — SPEAKING (5 reglas)
31. Speaking – Fluency breakdown

WHEN a student frequently stops speaking to self-correct
THEN delay correction until the task is completed
BECAUSE uninterrupted speech builds fluency and confidence.

32. Speaking – Memorized speech

WHEN a student relies on memorized chunks without adapting them
THEN introduce guided variation tasks (change place, time, person)
BECAUSE controlled variation promotes generative language use.

33. Speaking – Fear of public performance

WHEN a student avoids speaking in group settings
THEN start with pair or small-group speaking before whole-class tasks
BECAUSE reduced audience size lowers affective filter.

34. Speaking – Meaning vs accuracy conflict

WHEN accuracy correction interrupts communication
THEN prioritize meaning during speaking tasks and address accuracy afterward
BECAUSE communication-first practice maintains motivation.

35. Speaking – Lack of discourse structure

WHEN a student produces fragmented spoken ideas
THEN provide simple discourse frames (first / then / finally)
BECAUSE structural scaffolding improves coherence.

✍️ BLOQUE D — WRITING (5 reglas)
36. Writing – Blank page syndrome

WHEN a student delays writing due to lack of ideas
THEN provide guided prompts or sentence starters
BECAUSE reducing initiation barriers increases writing output.

37. Writing – Accuracy obsession

WHEN a student spends excessive time correcting form while writing
THEN separate drafting and editing into distinct stages
BECAUSE process-based writing reduces anxiety and improves quality.

38. Writing – Short, underdeveloped texts

WHEN a student produces very short written responses
THEN require expansion using guided questions (who / where / why)
BECAUSE guided elaboration strengthens expressive capacity.

39. Writing – Transfer from speaking

WHEN a student can express ideas orally but not in writing
THEN allow oral rehearsal before writing
BECAUSE oral planning supports written production.

40. Writing – Feedback overload

WHEN a student becomes demotivated after receiving extensive written corrections
THEN limit feedback to one or two priority error types
BECAUSE focused feedback is more actionable and motivating.
